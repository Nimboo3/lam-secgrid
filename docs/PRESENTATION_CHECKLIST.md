# üéØ FINAL PRESENTATION CHECKLIST & KEY POINTS

## PRE-PRESENTATION SETUP (5 minutes before)

### 1. Technical Setup
- [ ] Run `setup_demo.bat` to clear demo directories
- [ ] Verify virtual environment: `C:/Projects/lam-secgrid/venv/Scripts/python.exe --version`
- [ ] Test import: `python -c "import env, policies, attacks, defenses; print('Ready!')"`
- [ ] Have backup results ready: `dir results\backup*`

### 2. File Preparation
- [ ] Open DEMO_GUIDE.md for reference
- [ ] Have terminal ready in project directory
- [ ] Prepare to show code files if asked

## üé§ KEY TALKING POINTS

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"What happens when an AI agent that controls your smart home gets tricked into unlocking your door? Or when a trading bot gets manipulated into making unauthorized transactions? Today I'll show you a new type of attack that targets the action selection pipeline of Large Action Models."

### Problem Severity (1 minute)
**Why This Matters:**
- "LLMs generate text - if they fail, you get bad text"
- "LAMs take actions - if they fail, real-world consequences"
- "Think autonomous vehicles, medical devices, financial systems"
- "We need security research to keep pace with capability"

### Technical Innovation (1 minute)
**What's Novel:**
- "First systematic study of action injection vs prompt injection"
- "Action injection attacks the decision layer, not text generation"
- "Created reproducible benchmark for LAM security research"
- "Demonstrated both attack techniques and defense mechanisms"

---

## üìä CRITICAL NUMBERS TO MEMORIZE

### Attack Effectiveness:
- **100% Attack Success Rate** (without defenses)
- **-39 average reward** (vs +1.5 benign)
- **All 4 attack types** successful

### Defense Performance:
- **Sanitize: 0% ASR** (perfect protection)
- **Confirm: 100% ASR** (logical vulnerability)
- **~20 microseconds** defense overhead
- **0% False Positive Rate** on benign inputs

### Experimental Rigor:
- **Multiple attack styles** (direct, metadata, camouflaged)
- **Reproducible seeds** for consistency
- **Per-step logging** for complete traceability
- **Comprehensive metrics** (ASR, reward, latency, FPR)

## üéØ DEMO COMMAND SEQUENCE (Memorize These)

```bash
# 1. Show clean behavior
python run.py --episodes 5 --max_steps 20 --out results/demo_clean.csv

# 2. Demonstrate attacks  
python run_attacks.py --episodes 10 --max_steps 20 --out_dir results/demo_attacks --attacks direct metadata camouflaged

# 3. Show defenses
python run_experiments.py --episodes 10 --max_steps 20 --out_dir results/demo_defenses
```

### What to Show After Each Command:
1. **After run.py**: Open CSV, show no PRESS actions
2. **After run_attacks.py**: Show ASR summary (100% success) + plot
3. **After run_experiments.py**: Show defense comparison + visualization

---

## üõ°Ô∏è BACKUP PLAN

### If Live Demo Fails:
1. **Use backup results**: `results/backup_attacks/` and `results/backup_defenses/`
2. **Show attack injection code**: Demonstrate `attacks.inject()` manually
3. **Explain using existing CSVs**: Point to specific numbers in summary files
4. **Focus on methodology**: "The framework works, here are typical results..."

---

## üî• STRONG CLOSING STATEMENTS

### Research Impact:
"This work establishes the foundation for LAM security research. As these systems move from labs to production, we need systematic ways to find and fix vulnerabilities before deployment."

### Practical Relevance:
"Every company building autonomous agents needs to consider: How do we prevent manipulation of our decision pipeline? Our framework provides the testing methodology."

### Future Importance:
"Today we showed attacks in a toy gridworld. Tomorrow, similar techniques could target real robots, trading algorithms, or infrastructure systems. This research helps us stay ahead of that threat."

---

## ‚ùì ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: "Is this realistic for real LAMs?"**
A: "Yes - many LAM systems parse text for action keywords. The vulnerability pattern we exploit (substring triggers) is common in production systems."

**Q: "Why not test on GPT-4 or similar?"**
A: "Rule-based policy gives us interpretability - we can trace exactly how attacks work. Real LAMs would add noise that obscures the core security mechanisms."

**Q: "What about more sophisticated attacks?"**
A: "Great point - our framework is extensible. We could add coordinate spoofing, multi-step attacks, or context manipulation. This demonstrates the methodology."

**Q: "How do you scale this to complex environments?"**
A: "The principles transfer - perception manipulation, policy vulnerabilities, and defense strategies. GridWorld lets us study these cleanly before moving to complex domains."
