## ABSTRACT

Large Action Models (LAMs) represent the next evolution in artificial intelligence, moving beyond text generation to execute discrete actions in real-world environments. While extensive research has focused on prompt injection attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), the security implications of LAMs' action selection capabilities remain largely unexplored. This project introduces **action injection** - a novel class of attacks that manipulate the perception pipeline of LAMs to induce execution of unintended and potentially harmful actions.

We present the first systematic framework for studying action injection attacks, implementing a controlled GridWorld environment with interpretable rule-based policies that simulate LAM behavior. Our research demonstrates three classes of action injection attacks: direct instruction override, metadata poisoning, and camouflaged social engineering. We evaluate two defense mechanisms - input sanitization and action confirmation - across comprehensive metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR), utility impact, latency overhead, and False Positive Rate (FPR).

Experimental results show 100% attack success rate without defenses, complete mitigation through sanitization (0% ASR), and identification of logical vulnerabilities in confirmation-based defenses. This work establishes foundational methodology for LAM security research, providing reproducible evaluation infrastructure critical for safe deployment of autonomous action-taking AI systems.

## INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background

The artificial intelligence landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation from Large Language Models (LLMs) that generate text to Large Action Models (LAMs) that execute discrete actions in real-world environments. This evolution represents a paradigm shift from passive text generation to active environmental manipulation, encompassing autonomous vehicles, robotic systems, smart home controllers, financial trading algorithms, and medical device management.

Traditional LLMs, while powerful in text generation, are fundamentally limited to producing linguistic output. Their security vulnerabilities, particularly prompt injection attacks, result in corrupted text generation but do not directly impact physical systems. LAMs, however, bridge the gap between language understanding and environmental action, creating new attack surfaces with potentially severe real-world consequences.

The security implications of this transition are profound. When an LLM generates inappropriate content due to prompt injection, the impact is contained within the digital text domain. When a LAM executes unintended actions due to manipulated inputs, the consequences can include physical harm, financial loss, privacy violations, and infrastructure disruption.

Current LAM implementations typically follow a perception-decision-action pipeline: environmental information is processed into textual or structured representations, a decision-making component (often based on language models) interprets this information to select appropriate actions, and actuators execute the chosen actions. This pipeline introduces multiple potential attack vectors, particularly in the perception-to-decision interface where textual manipulation can influence action selection.

### 1.2 Motivations

The motivation for this research stems from the critical gap between the rapid deployment of action-capable AI systems and the lag in security research addressing their unique vulnerabilities. Several factors drive the urgency of this work:

**Deployment Acceleration:** Major technology companies are rapidly integrating action capabilities into AI systems. OpenAI's function calling, Google's ReAct agents, and Microsoft's Copilot with plugin execution represent early implementations of LAM-like capabilities. These systems are moving from research prototypes to production deployments without comprehensive security evaluation.

**High-Stakes Applications:** LAMs are being deployed in critical domains where security failures have severe consequences. Autonomous vehicles processing road sign information, smart home systems interpreting voice commands, financial trading algorithms parsing market signals, and medical devices following protocol instructions all represent high-risk deployment scenarios.

**Limited Security Research:** While prompt injection against LLMs has received significant attention, the distinct security challenges of action injection remain largely unexplored. The academic and industry security communities have not yet established systematic methodologies for evaluating and defending against action-layer attacks.

**Proactive Security Need:** History demonstrates that security vulnerabilities in new technology paradigms are exploited rapidly once identified. The transition to action-capable AI systems creates a window of opportunity for proactive security research before widespread malicious exploitation occurs.

**Regulatory Pressure:** Emerging AI governance frameworks increasingly emphasize safety and security requirements for autonomous systems. Organizations deploying LAMs will need systematic security evaluation methodologies to demonstrate compliance and due diligence.

### 1.3 Scope of the Project

This project establishes foundational methodology for systematic study of action injection attacks against Large Action Models. The scope encompasses:

**Primary Focus:** Development and evaluation of action injection attack techniques that manipulate LAM perception inputs to induce unintended action execution. This includes creation of attack taxonomies, defense mechanisms, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

**Environmental Context:** Implementation of a controlled GridWorld environment that provides full observability and reproducibility while maintaining sufficient complexity to demonstrate realistic attack scenarios. The environment serves as a standardized testbed for LAM security research.

**Policy Framework:** Utilization of interpretable rule-based policies that simulate LAM decision-making while enabling complete traceability of attack causality. This approach prioritizes methodological rigor and reproducibility over black-box model complexity.

**Defense Analysis:** Systematic evaluation of defense mechanisms including input sanitization and action confirmation, with analysis of their effectiveness, performance impact, and failure modes.

**Evaluation Methodology:** Establishment of comprehensive metrics for LAM security assessment including Attack Success Rate (ASR), utility impact measurement, defense latency analysis, and False Positive Rate (FPR) calculation.

**Research Infrastructure:** Creation of extensible, reproducible experimental framework that enables community research and systematic comparison of security approaches.

**Current Limitations:** This initial phase focuses on single-agent scenarios in controlled environments using simplified action spaces. Multi-agent coordination attacks, complex real-world environments, and integration with production LAM systems are designated for future work phases.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND GOALS

### 2.1 Literature Review

#### 2.1.1 Large Language Model Security

The security of Large Language Models has been extensively studied, with prompt injection emerging as the primary vulnerability class. Prompt injection attacks manipulate model inputs to override intended behavior, typically causing models to generate inappropriate, harmful, or unintended text outputs.

**Classical Prompt Injection:** Wei et al. (2023) demonstrated direct instruction attacks where adversarial prompts explicitly override system instructions. These attacks exploit the lack of clear boundaries between system instructions and user inputs in current LLM architectures.

**Indirect Prompt Injection:** Greshake et al. (2023) identified indirect attacks where malicious instructions are embedded in external content (web pages, documents, emails) that models process during retrieval-augmented generation. This attack vector significantly expands the potential attack surface.

**Jailbreaking Techniques:** Zou et al. (2023) developed automated adversarial prompt generation techniques that systematically discover inputs causing models to violate safety guidelines. Their work demonstrates the fragility of current alignment approaches against sophisticated attacks.

**Defense Mechanisms:** Current LLM defenses focus on output filtering, input sanitization, and improved training procedures. Liu et al. (2023) surveyed prompt injection defenses, noting limited effectiveness against adaptive attacks and high false positive rates.

#### 2.1.2 Autonomous Agent Security

Research on autonomous agent security has primarily focused on robotics and control systems, with limited attention to language-based action selection vulnerabilities.

**Adversarial Examples in Robotics:** Eykholt et al. (2018) demonstrated physical adversarial attacks against computer vision systems in autonomous vehicles, showing how modified road signs can cause misclassification and potentially dangerous behavior.

**Command Injection in IoT:** Research by Fernandes et al. (2016) identified command injection vulnerabilities in IoT devices where malformed inputs can cause unintended device actions. However, this work focuses on traditional software vulnerabilities rather than AI-specific attack vectors.

**Multi-Agent System Security:** Tampering attacks against multi-agent reinforcement learning systems have been studied by Zhang et al. (2020), but these focus on reward manipulation rather than perception-level attacks.

#### 2.1.3 Action Space Vulnerabilities

Limited work has addressed security vulnerabilities specific to action selection in AI systems.

**Function Calling Security:** Recent work by Schuster et al. (2024) identified vulnerabilities in LLM function calling where malicious prompts can cause inappropriate API invocations. This represents the closest existing work to action injection, but lacks systematic methodology and comprehensive evaluation.

**Tool Use Manipulation:** Mialon et al. (2023) surveyed language model tool use capabilities but did not address security implications of external tool invocation based on potentially manipulated text inputs.

### 2.2 Research Gaps

Analysis of existing literature reveals several critical gaps in LAM security research:

#### 2.2.1 Action vs. Text Generation Distinction

**Gap:** Current security research focuses almost exclusively on text generation attacks, with minimal consideration of how these techniques translate to action selection contexts.

**Implication:** The fundamental difference between generating harmful text (which can be filtered or ignored) and executing harmful actions (which have immediate real-world consequences) requires distinct threat models and defense strategies.

**Our Contribution:** First systematic study distinguishing action injection from prompt injection, with formal threat models specific to action execution contexts.

#### 2.2.2 Systematic Evaluation Methodology

**Gap:** Existing work on AI agent security lacks standardized evaluation metrics, reproducible experimental frameworks, and systematic comparison methodologies.

**Implication:** Without systematic evaluation approaches, security research remains fragmented and difficult to compare across different systems and attack scenarios.

**Our Contribution:** Comprehensive evaluation framework with standardized metrics (ASR, utility impact, latency, FPR) and reproducible experimental methodology for community use.

#### 2.2.3 Defense Mechanism Analysis

**Gap:** While LLM defenses have been extensively studied, their effectiveness and limitations in action execution contexts remain unexplored.

**Implication:** Organizations deploying LAMs lack systematic guidance on defense selection, implementation, and evaluation.

**Our Contribution:** Comprehensive analysis of defense mechanisms including effectiveness evaluation, performance impact assessment, and failure mode identification.

#### 2.2.4 Attack Taxonomy Development

**Gap:** No systematic taxonomy exists for classifying action injection attacks, hindering development of comprehensive defense strategies.

**Implication:** Without clear attack classification, defenders cannot systematically address the full spectrum of potential threats.

**Our Contribution:** Novel attack taxonomy including direct injection, metadata poisoning, and camouflaged social engineering attacks.

### 2.4 Problem Statement

**Core Problem:** Large Action Models (LAMs) that execute discrete actions based on textual perception inputs are vulnerable to action injection attacks where maliciously crafted input text causes execution of unintended and potentially harmful actions, yet no systematic methodology exists for studying, evaluating, or defending against such attacks.

**Specific Challenges:**

1. **Attack Surface Identification:** The perception-to-action pipeline in LAMs creates new attack vectors distinct from traditional prompt injection, but these vectors lack systematic characterization.

2. **Threat Model Formalization:** Existing threat models focus on text generation attacks and do not adequately address the unique characteristics of action execution contexts.

3. **Defense Strategy Development:** Current LLM defense mechanisms are designed for text generation and may not translate effectively to action execution scenarios.

4. **Evaluation Methodology Gap:** No standardized framework exists for evaluating LAM security, measuring attack effectiveness, or comparing defense mechanisms.

5. **Real-World Impact Assessment:** The consequences of successful action injection attacks in deployed systems remain poorly understood and unquantified.

**Research Questions:**

- **RQ1:** What classes of action injection attacks are possible against LAMs, and how can they be systematically characterized?
- **RQ2:** How effective are different defense mechanisms against action injection attacks, and what are their performance trade-offs?
- **RQ3:** What evaluation methodology provides reproducible, comprehensive assessment of LAM security?
- **RQ4:** How do action injection attacks differ from prompt injection attacks in terms of threat model, attack techniques, and defense requirements?
