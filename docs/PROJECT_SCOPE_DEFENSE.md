## üí° THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

### **Formal Framework Development:**

1. **Threat Model Formalization**
   ```
   T = (A, V, E, D, M)
   Where:
   A = Attack capabilities (injection, manipulation)
   V = Vulnerabilities (parsing, triggers)  
   E = Environment constraints (observability, actions)
   D = Defense mechanisms (sanitization, confirmation)
   M = Metrics (ASR, utility, performance)
   ```

2. **Security Properties Definition**
   - **Action Integrity**: Executed actions match intended policy
   - **Perception Authenticity**: Input text reflects true environment state
   - **Defense Completeness**: All attack classes are covered
   - **Performance Preservation**: Security doesn't degrade utility

3. **Theoretical Bounds**
   - Maximum achievable ASR under perfect defense
   - Minimum defense overhead for security guarantees
   - Trade-off curves between security and utility
